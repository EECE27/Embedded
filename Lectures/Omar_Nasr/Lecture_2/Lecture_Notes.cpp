    Back to Data Structures....

    ? Classes, Linked List Revision
    ? Stacks and Queues.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ? Classes:
    - Its an abstraction (Abstract Data Type).
    - Data Structures can be written without classes.
    - Define Data Visibility:
        - Public: Can be accessed outside of the class
        - Private: Can only be accessed by functions inside the class
        - Protected: Accessible by inheritance in derived classes.

    ?Conustructors & Destructors:
    - Constructors are special functions automatically created when an object is created
    - Destructors are special functions automatically crreated when an object is destroyed
    (Intuative!)

    The end of the life time of an object is typically at the end of the function or program life time
    unless it was dynamically allocated.
